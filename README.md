## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes
instagram - noes, music lyrics in notes 
tiktok - keeping the same type of videos in your algorithm , notes 
instagram- story likes, ai bot that helps in search bar
facetime- word text on screen, screen sharing 

instagram is an app that a lot of people have now started to use the most where you can see your friends post and post whats going on in your life. One feature i would like to improve is length of the song inside the notes and stories This is simpky because sometimes i feel likei owuld need the song to go longer to get to the pert of the song i would like to hear 

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

one challenge i encounter was the ibaction part of the assignment where i created multiple of them so the button function wasnt working along with changing the color i had to debug it by going over my steps until i realized i had multiple of the same ibactions and this was being override so when i would click the button the randomize color background function wasnt working due to multiple ibaction
